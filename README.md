Automaton Test
==============

Test application project for automaton. This is where we sketch out new framework features and keep working examples of 
things. 

So far it does not do any automated testing and it might never get one. Each library in our eco system has unit tests 
and of course we will have integration tests for the application we make for our customer(s). Here the tests are mostly
manual. 


GraphQL Domain
--------------

Often we will model simplified versions of problems in our customer applications here. The domain of this application
means nothing and is full of types named after metasyntactic variables.

The purpose of the entities is to serve as an example for all similarly structured entities. Abstract application 
without meaning. 

On a technical level the applications often illustrate how functionality works maybe more clearly then the documentation
at times and a running example in any case.
 
The file [automatontest.backup](https://github.com/quinscape/automaton-test/blob/master/automatontest.backup) contains a Postgresql 10 database dump of the database from which the current
GraphQL schema in [schema.graphql](https://github.com/quinscape/automaton-test/blob/master/schema.graphql) was created.
(Where still doing database-schema-first at this point)
